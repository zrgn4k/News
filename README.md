# News

News application made with SwiftUI which allows users to read news articles and save them for reading later.

The Application consists of 2 tabs. First tab represent a list of articles that user can tap to open a in-app Safari Web View, or save them for later reading by swiping left.

The second tab is the username and the list of saved articles to read later.

Application was created using [Swift 5](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)

[NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) was used to get new articles.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full-stack developer with massive hands-on experience in different areas and instruments, such as Ð¡++, C#, TypeScript, Swift, SQL and big amount of educational projects.
